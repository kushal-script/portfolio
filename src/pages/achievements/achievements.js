We as a team of 4 built a basic prototype of a web application named 'SpotItFixIt' which is a crowd-sourcing platform for reporting and fixing problems in the city. The application allows users to report problems, view reported problems on a map, report the problem to higher authorities or take initiative and provide solutions to fix them.",
